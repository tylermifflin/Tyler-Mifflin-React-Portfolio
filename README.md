## Description
This app is a Portfolio page built for Tyler Mifflin using React. The app has a Header component that is used for every page that shows my name and has links to About Me, Portfolio, Resume, and Contact. The app includes a Footer component that renders on every page with link icons to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and Instagram profiles. When the page first loads, the About Me page will render as the default homepage. When the user clicks Portfolio, the Portfolio container will render with 6 of my projects displayed with images and links to the deployed project and GitHub page. When the user clicks Resume, a list of my skills and a link to my Resume will render. When the user clicks Contact, a contact form will render where the user can enter their name, email, and a message to me. If the user clicks submit without filling out a field in either name, email, or message, an alert message will let the user know they need to fill out the field that was missed. The email section will also give them an alert message if the user does not enter a valid email address. I learned a lot about how to use React with bootstrap and how to make custome CSS styling in React.
